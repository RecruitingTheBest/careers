## Product and Engineering Principles

**We believe in being paid for quality work**

There's an incredible amount of software infrastructure that is under funded and ignored.
We believe our software needs to generate revenue to employ the best minds.

**We balance openness and transparency**

We work as much as we can in the open; our commits, designs, and comments are largely in public repositories for anyone to use and observe.
We strive to find balance in open-core and community friendly software versus competing in a dynamic and evolving market segment.

All our security critical code is developed in the open.
Our independent audits [get published](https://goteleport.com/resources/audits/), even the unflattering ones.

**We want to tackle and solve the hard problems**

We want to minimize the theater in security products, and offer meaningful improvements to security posture.
We want to focus on the user, having a product that users aren't trying to work around to get their jobs done.
We want to end passwords as a vehicle for trust, including passwords in disguise such as tokens.
