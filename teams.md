# Summary

This is meant to be a general guide to learn about the different kinds of projects our engineering teams are working on at Teleport and to help decide which may be the best fit for those looking to join.

## Core

The Teleport Core team is focused on design and development of the core product: Teleport. It is split into multiple sub-teams that work on specific areas of the product.

### Server and Kubernetes Access

The Server and Kubernetes Access team works on [SSH](https://goteleport.com/ssh-server-access/) and [Kubernetes](https://goteleport.com/kubernetes-access/) servers and proxies. The team recently added support for [eBPF based restricted sessions](https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/restricted-session) and is working on extending eBPF based monitoring and access controls to Kubernetes clusters.

### Application and Database Access

The Application and Database Access team works on providing access to [web applications](https://goteleport.com/docs/application-access) and [databases](https://goteleport.com/docs/database-access/) behind NATs and firewalls with security and compliance needs. The team has recently worked on adding [certificate based authentication support to CLI applications](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5918) and adding support for the [MongoDB protocol](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7213) to Database Access.

#### Here are the examples of projects you may be working on:

* Adding support for more database access [protocols](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adatabase-access+label%3Adb%2Frequested) and improving the existing ones.
* Working on [features](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aapplication-access+label%3Afeature-request) for application access identity-aware proxy.
* Building advanced access controls such as [session recording](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5799), [data masking](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/7150) and [per-session MFA](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6172).
* Implementing cloud access solutions for AWS, GCP and Azure.
* Improving the UX of application and database access products.

### Product Security

The Product Security team is focused on application security for the entire product. This team implements security controls and works with security researchers to find and fix security vulnerabilities.

The team has recently added support for [Per-Session MFA](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa/), [Access Requests](https://goteleport.com/docs/enterprise/workflow/), [user and session locking](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7286), and mitigated issued found during [security audits](https://goteleport.com/resources/audits/).

### Performance and Scaling

The Performance and Scaling team is focused on scaling, performance, and robustness of Teleport in large deployments.

The team is currently working on scaling Teleport to [100k node clusters](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4173) and [secure automatic upgrades](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6691) of large fleets of servers.

### Teleport Terminal

The Teleport Terminal team is focused on creating desktop applications that make Teleport easier to use and more secure.

The team is working on pairing [hardware devices](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7808) with certificate authentication to give users a seamless highly secure environment.

### Desktop Access

The Teleport Desktop Access team is focused on secure and user-friendly remote desktop access.

The team is currently working on browser-based [Windows Desktop Access](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7725).

### Frontend Applications

The Teleport Frontend Applications team is focused on building user-friendly web applications.

* Adding session event player to the audit log.
* Building a new user interface for Teleport's terminal.
* Improving Node Search. [#2699](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2699)
* Ability to comment / link to specific times in recorded sessions. [#996](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/996)
* Adding better support for WebAuthn (second factor).

### Internal Tools

The Internal Tools team is focused on building simple and secure foundational tools and processes to increase developer autonomy and productivity in a distributed environment.

* Workflow automation bots [#8116](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8116)
* Designing and building next generation CI and CD platforms.

### Teleport Devops

Teleport DevOps is responsible for building, maintaining, and testing open-source modules for various configuration management platforms. This will be the open-source code that enables both our OSS and Enterprise customers to deploy and maintain Teleport on their chosen configuration management system. Weâ€™re looking to cover Kubernetes, Terraform on various clouds, Ansible, Salt, Puppet, etc.


## Cloud

Teleport Cloud is the SaaS version of Teleport launched in early 2021.
As the team backing it, we build, secure, monitor, maintain, scale, investigate,
and automate our production environment backing Teleport Cloud. Our work
includes a wide variety of projects drawing on various skill sets, from ensuring
we're up to date on patches to redesigning and developing useful-to-cloud
features of Teleport Core.

### Technologies

We use the following technologies to build Teleport Cloud:

* Golang
* Typescript & React
* PostgreSQL
* Terraform and Packer
* Amazon Web Services
* Kubernetes
* Prometheus / Alertmanager / Loki internally and on Grafana Cloud
* Drone.io

### Cloud Security

We're just starting our cloud security team, a hands-on and code-first group of
engineers dedicated to the security of our hosted Teleport Cloud.  If you're an
experienced, opinionated security professional come help us secure Teleport.
Projects in our Roadmap include:

* Coordinating with red teams (both internal and external) to rapidly respond
  and mitigate issues.
* Remediating AWS access errors, design and implement proactive tooling to avoid
  similar mistakes.
* Improving our vulnerability management and disclosure process.


### Cloud Reliability

Our Cloud Reliability Team defines and builds a culture around production,
ensuring sublinear scaling of operations against company/product growth.

Some projects we're working on right now:

* Expanding Teleport Cloud to multiple regions, reducing latency between users
  and their infrastructure.
* Defining SLOs, and developing  centralized monitoring and alerting based on them
* Evaluating and implementing database and storage solutions that match or
  exceed our SLOs and growth demands
* Developing procedures and automation to ensure reliable and safe rollouts

### Cloud Applications

As the applications team for Teleport Cloud, we manage the Teleport deployments
for our cloud customers and provide a stable, easy-to-use product.

The team intersects with almost all other departments in the company and offers
a broad range of projects. For example:

* Building Kubernetes operators
* Developing subscription & billing logic
* Contributing UI & UX improvements for Teleport
* Rewriting Teleport core networking to work better for cloud use cases.
* Asset distribution

### Cloud Tooling

The Cloud Tooling team contributes force multiplication efforts to help
engineers developing Teleport Cloud and across the org. We're currently working
on:

* Building and maintaining Teleport clusters that engineers use to securely
  access our infrastructure backing Teleport Cloud.
* Improving static analysis and automated tests.
* Developing security conscious CI guidelines and tooling.
* While we build up the Cloud Security team, tooling is heavily invested in
  improving our security posture
  audit trail for generated and published assets and ensuring we're using
  encryption at rest in the right places.
